A Continuous Double Auction (CDA) is a type of trading mechanism used in financial markets, such as stock exchanges and electronic trading platforms. 
With the following key rules:

Continuous Trading: trading occurs continuously throughout the trading session, rather than being divided into discrete trading periods.

Buy and Sell Orders: Participants can submit both buy and sell orders at any time during the trading session. They have the following properties:

    - Buy orders represent the desire to purchase a security at a specified price or lower, while sell orders represent the desire to sell a security at a specified price or higher.

    - Price and Quantity: Each order specifies both a price and a quantity. The price represents the maximum (for buy orders) or minimum (for sell orders) that the trader is willing to accept. 
      The quantity represents the number of shares or units the trader wishes to buy or sell.

Matching/Trading: The trading system continuously matches buy and sell orders based on their prices. 
    - Trades occur when:
        - a buy order's price is equal to or greater than a sell order's price or
        - when a sell order's price is equal to or less than a buy order's price.

Priority Rules: In case of multiple buy or sell orders at the same price, priority rules determine the order in which they are matched. 
These rules can vary but often follow a time priority, where the order entered into the system first gets matched first.

Immediate Execution: Orders are executed immediately upon finding a match, assuming there are matching orders available in the market. These types of orders are also known as Market Orders.

Transparency: CDA systems often provide transparency by displaying real-time information about current buy and sell orders, including their prices and quantities.

Flexibility: Participants can cancel their orders at any time before they are matched. This allows traders to react to new information or changing market conditions.
